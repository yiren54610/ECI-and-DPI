# Economic Confidence vs. Income Level Changes During Trump's and Biden's Administrations  

## Overview  
This project analyzes the relationship between public confidence in the economy and changes in income levels during the first administrations of Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The data is sourced from two reputable organizations:  

- **Gallup News**: Provides data on public confidence in the economy, measured through surveys that capture how optimistic or pessimistic people feel about current and future economic conditions.  
- **U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**: Provides data on income level changes, specifically focusing on metrics such as personal income growth, disposable income, and wage trends.  

The goal of this analysis is to compare how economic confidence and income levels evolved during the two administrations, highlighting potential correlations or divergences between public sentiment and economic performance.  

## Key Metrics  

### 1. Economic Confidence (Gallup News)  
- **Definition**: A composite index based on Americans' ratings of current economic conditions and their outlook on whether the economy is improving or worsening.  
- **Scale**: Ranges from -100 (extremely low confidence) to +100 (extremely high confidence).  
- **Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly data, depending on availability.  

### 2. Income Level Changes (U.S. BEA)  
- **Definition**: Measures changes in personal real disposable income adjusted for inflation.  
- **Metrics**:  
  - **Real Disposable Income**: Income available after taxes and adjusted for inflation.  

## Data Sources  
- **Gallup News**: [Gallup Economic Confidence Data](https://news.gallup.com)  
  - Provides historical data on economic confidence indices.  
- **U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**: [BEA Personal Income Data](https://www.bea.gov)  
  - Provides detailed data on income levels, disposable income, and wage trends.  

## Methodology  

### Data Collection  
- Economic confidence data was extracted from Gallup News for the periods covering Trump’s first term (January 2017 - January 2021) and Biden’s first term (January 2021 - 2024).  
- Income level data was sourced from the U.S. BEA for the same periods.  

### Data Alignment  
- Data points were aligned by month or quarter to ensure consistency in comparisons.  
- Adjustments were made for inflation to provide a real-term analysis of income changes.  

### Visualization  
- The chart compares economic confidence (Gallup) and income level changes (BEA) over time.  
- Trends are highlighted to show how public sentiment and economic performance correlate or diverge during each administration.  

## Key Insights  

### Trump Administration (2017-2021)  
- Economic confidence trends and income level changes during this period.  
- Notable events (e.g., tax cuts, trade policies, COVID-19 pandemic) and their impact on both metrics.  

### Biden Administration (2021-2024)  
- Economic confidence trends and income level changes during this period.  
- Notable events (e.g., stimulus packages, infrastructure bills, inflation trends) and their impact on both metrics.  

### Comparative Analysis  
- How economic confidence and income levels compare between the two administrations.  
- Potential explanations for observed trends, such as policy differences, external shocks, or public perception.  

The chart allows users to:  
- Observe trends in economic confidence and income levels over time.  
- Compare the two administrations side by side.  
- Identify periods of alignment or divergence between public sentiment and economic performance.  

## Limitations  
- **Data Granularity**: Some data points may be available only at a quarterly level, limiting the ability to analyze monthly trends.  
- **External Factors**: The analysis does not account for all external factors (e.g., global economic conditions, geopolitical events) that may influence the data.  
- **Causation vs. Correlation**: The chart highlights correlations but does not establish causation between economic confidence and income levels.  

## Future Work  
- Expand the analysis to include additional economic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates, GDP growth).  
- Incorporate demographic breakdowns to understand how different groups perceive the economy and experience income changes.  
- Extend the timeline to include full presidential terms or multiple administrations for a broader perspective.
